GeoSocialVis, an interactive visualization tool for scientometrics analyses with a focus on displaying the geosocial co-authorship network. GeoSocialVis uses a novel force layout that strikes a user-defined balance between showing network topology and the geographic locations of the authors. Users can explore relevant publications, researchers, groups, and institutions by adjusting the balance between topology and geography, searching by keywords, and with details-on-demand. We demonstrate the utility of GeoSocialVis with a case study with IEEE Information Visualization  2008--2018 publication data. An interactive demo is available online [here.](https://dsaffo.github.io/GeoSocialVis/)
